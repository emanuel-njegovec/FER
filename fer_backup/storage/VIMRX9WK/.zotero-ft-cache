Introduction

The Internet is one of the 20th century's most groundbreaking inventions. However, it was already in this century, with the advent of the mobile smart phone and its widespread usage, that ordinary people noticed its impact: everyone uses a computer and/or smart phone to perform everyday tasks, such as viewing emails, browsing news, chatting with friends and playing games. Most of these tasks are performed via web browsers: the most widely used software tool to access internet [1]. While in the very beginning, web browsers were used to navigate via static web (HTML) documents, soon dynamic features were included in web pages to make them more expressive. In fact, already in 1995, Netscape and Sun reported JavaScript (JS) as an “easy-to-use object scripting language designed for creating live online applications that link together objects and resources on both clients and servers”. Thus, JavaScript became the de facto standard client-side web scripting language for over 20 years. As a consequence, browsers need to co-evolve to support the dynamic behaviour of web pages expressed by JavaScript programs. In fact, browsers are now very much like operating systems: they need to read/parse web documents with embedded JavaScript programs, which define their behaviour, and to interpret/compile/execute such programs to provide the desired dynamic behaviour. Because JavaScript source code is on the web (downloaded together with the static part of the webpage), its security and efficiency are of major concern. Internet attacks are often performed by injecting malicious code into the JavaScript component of the web page being downloaded/executed [2].

Although JavaScript technology has improved by using advanced Virtual Machines (VM) offering both Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and GPU support, JavaScript is also known to have poor performance as shown in recent surveys on the performance of 27 programming languages implementing the same 10 software problems: JavaScript is in position 15 in the reported ranking and it is 6.5 times slower and 4.45 times more energy greedy than the C language (the fastest and greenest in that ranking) [3]–​ [5]. For numerical computations JavaScript is within a factor of 2 of C [6].

To overcome the limitations of JavaScript, software developers from the four major browsers designed Web Assembly (Wasm) as a fast, safe, portable low-level bytecode tailored for Web-based applications [7]. Like many bytecode formats, Web Assembly aims to be the compilation target for the Web, which like the code produced by a C compiler is highly optimized at code generation time. By being a binary format, Wasm is transmitted over the network much faster than JavaScript and thus reducing load times. Moreover, Wasm is designed such that function bodies are placed after all declarations, thus allowing browsers to minimize pageload latency by starting streaming compilation as soon as functions arrive over the wire. This feature also allows parallel function body decoding and compilation.

As a consequence of this modern design, when a C program is compiled to Wasm instead of JavaScript, it runs 34% faster on the Google Chrome browser [7]. Although speed is a key aspect of an application, the widely use of powerful mobile computing devices is making the energy consumption another relevant aspect of software [8]. Unfortunately, there is no work on analysing the energy efficiency of browsers running Wasm applications. In this paper, we analyse the performance of Wasm, both in terms of it execution time and energy efficiency. Moreover, we compare the performance of 10 Wasm applications to their JavaScript counterparts. Thus, we aim to answer the following research questions:

RQ1: Is Wasm currently more run-time efficient than JS?

RQ2: Is Wasm currently more energy efficient than JS?

RQ3: Does performance scale differently for Wasm and JS depending on the input size?

Although WebAssembly is still in a very early phase, our preliminary results show that there is already a slight difference in performance, with Web Assembly being faster and more energy-efficient most of the time. In fact, Wasm is consistently more energetically efficient and faster than JS when programs are executed with small inputs. Our results also show that with larger inputs, Wasm programs are still faster and greener but the gap is minor.

This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents Web Assembly and supporting tools/compilers. Section III details the methodology followed to design and execute our benchmarks and preliminary study. In Section IV we analyze and discuss in detail the performance of Wasm and JS benchmark programs. We discuss the threats to validity of our study in Section V. Finally, we present the related work in Section VI and our conclusions in Section VII.

SECTION II.
WebAssembly's Ecosystem

WebAssembly is the result of a pioneer collaboration between software engineers from the four most widely used Web browsers, namely Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. WebAssembly was developed with two main goals: speed and safety [7]. By being a binary/bytecode format, Wasm is design as a target format1. Wasm programs are typically produced by compiling existing programs written in high level programming languages (such as C/C++, Rust and Haskell) to Wasm binaries. Very much like a binary program produced by a C compiler, the produced Wasm program is highly optimized at compilation time. Such an optimized binary program offers other web application features: compact format (saving bandwidth), reduced load time, and streaming and parallel decoding/compilation.

There are several compiler frameworks that already target Wasm: Cheerp2 is an enterprise C/C++ compiler for the Web, based and integrated into the LLVM/Clang infrastructure. It allows compiling virtually any C/C++ code to Wasm, JavaScript, and asm.js. Emscripten3 is a complete open source compiler toolchain for WebAssembly. Using Emscripten it is possible to compile C/C++ code, or any other language that uses LLVM, into Wasm, and run it on the Web, Node.js, or other Wasm runtimes. Another WebAssembly compiler is Asterius4: a Haskell to WebAssembly compiler based on GHC. It compiles Haskell source code to WebAssembly and JavaScript code, which can be executed in Node.js or Web browsers. Figure 1 shows a simple example of Emscripten compiling the well-know “hello world” C program into JavaScript (left) and Wasm (right).

SECTION III.
Benchmark Design And Execution

WebAssembly was recently designed to bring the Web up to speed [7]. Although the language and its supporting tools, namely compilers and virtual machines, are still very novel, it is important to assess how they are keeping up with their promise. Thus, the primary motivation of this work is to understand how Wasm currently compares to JavaScript, both in terms of energy consumption and run-time efficiency.

To generate equivalent Wasm and JavaScript programs, we need a supported source program. Thus, we used C programs for our solutions, which will also be included in this performance analysis so that we can compare Wasm with native code, as studies have shown it to be the golden standard for programming language efficiency [4], [5].

Our benchmarking framework consists of four steps: 1) Embedding input data, 2) Compilation to Wasm/JS, 3) Energy and run-time measuring, and 4) Data Collection. The following sub-sections will describe each of these steps, beginning with a description of our chosen benchmark problems and solutions. Additionally, our benchmarking framework is publicly available5 for both researchers and practitioners to both replicate and build upon. Finally, Figure 2 presents the overview of our benchmarking framework.

A. Benchmark Programs

WebAssembly was designed to be used in compute-intensive cases such as compression, encryption, image processing, games, and numeric computations. For this preliminary study, we focused on computational heavy operations where performance is a concern.

One such operation was sorting, which we obtained a total of 8 different sorting algorithm solutions from Rosetta Code6. Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy repository that presents solutions to over a thousand programming tasks in as many different languages as possible. Additionally, we also included two Wasm compatible7 intensive benchmark problems from the Computer Language Benchmarks Game (CLBG): fannkuch-redux and fasta. The CLBG8 is a website competition aimed at comparing the performance of several programming languages, with heavily optimized solutions written by corresponding language experts. The collected source code of all solutions were written in the C language, to be then compiled into their respective WebAssembly and JavaScript versions in a future stage.

Fig. 2.

Benchmark framework overview

Both Rosetta Code and CLBG have been previously used for comparing the performance of programming languages and/or analyze their energy efficiency [3]–​ [5], [9]–​ [14]. Finally, shown in Table I is the list of our benchmarks and their brief description, totalling 10 unique solutions.

B. Embedded Inputs

The performance of a program can vary depending on its complexity and the effort required for its execution. Thus, in our preliminary study, we have categorized three sizes of input data for each benchmark: Small, Medium, and Large. While the input size and data varies between the different benchmarks, they are consistent between the three languages under test (C, Wasm, and JS) within a given benchmark.

For each of the 8 sorting benchmarks, the inputs were randomly generated unsorted lists of values. The size of Large inputs was chosen so that they could be processed by all three languages without running out of memory. Our Medium input was half the size of our Large, and the Small input was half the size of our Medium. The Large size varied across the different benchmarks. For the remainder 2 benchmarks from CLBG, we based the sizes off their competition's input sizes, with small modifications applied when needed to execute with no errors, and have sizeable (yet not overly sizeable) inputs. Full details on the input sizes/data for all benchmarks can be seen on the framework's GitHub page.

Table I Benchmarks details.

Emscripten, while an LLVM based tool, does not currently support a few libraries that traditional LLVMs do, such as those for defining file input/output for a normal commandline experience. As a workaround, instead of passing input/datasets during execution, all the input datasets, for all languages, are in a C header file (where more inputs can be easily added). When compiling the benchmarks to Wasm, JavaScript, or C, macros are used to specify the size of the input data, which will be compiled directly into the program. An example of such a header file is shown in Listing 1.

Listing 1.

Example input header file.

C. Compiling to WebAssembly and JavaScript

In order to compile our C based benchmarks into the respective Wasm and JavaScript versions, we used Emscripten for the compilation process. We chose Emscripten as it is open source, already used by researchers and practitioners [7], [15], [16], and offers extensive documentation9.

When Emscripten compiles a C program to Wasm, it creates two files, .wasm and .js, that work together. The .wasm file contains the translated code from the C benchmark, and the .js file (denominated as glue code) is the main target of compilation that will load and set up the Wasm code. Similarly, compiling to JavaScript creates the .js file containing the translated code, and creates a .mem file containing the static memory initialization data.

Currently, a makefile automatically compiles each benchmark solution (in C, Wasm, and JS) with each one of the corresponding input sizes. Each makefile contains a series of command variables containing the compilation and execution string for the corresponding language and input size. However, it is trivial to add new or modify input and testing scenarios within our benchmarking framework. After fully compiling the program artefacts for each benchmark, each compiled program was executed and verified to produce the correct output/result.

Finally, considering our 3 input sizes (defined in the previous sub-section), with our 3 languages (C, Wasm, and JS), across the 10 benchmarking problems, we have a final total of 90 unique compiled programs which will be analyzed.

D. Measuring Energy and Run-time

To accurately measure the energy consumption of each benchmark solution, we used Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)10 to measure the energy consumed by the system's Package, CPU, GPU, and DRAM in Joules. RAPL has already been shown to provide very accurate energy measurements [17], high sampling rate (10ms), and has been used in several studies on energy consumption and software [4], [5], [10], [18]–​ [21].

As to guarantee no register overflow11 occurs when measuring with RAPL, a C based thread is executed alongside the benchmark execution, continuously sampling the energy consumption using RAPL. Additionally, this thread also registers the start and end run-time of the executed benchmark. In order to collect consistent data and reduce effects from cold starts, warm-ups, and cache effects, each benchmark was executed twenty times [22], with a sleep of five seconds between each execution.

All measurements were performed on a Linux Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS operating system, with 16GB of RAM, Intel® Core™ i7 8750H 1.80 GHz Maximum Boost Speed 1.99 GHz, with a Coffee Lake micro-architecture.

E. Data Collection

The final step of our benchmarking framework is the data collection. We have created a Python script, cleanresults.py, that automatically aggregates all the RAPL energy samples per benchmark-input-language-execution. The final result is a CSV file for each benchmark-size pair containing the results of all three languages, with their RAPL samplings combined. Each CSV presents the results for each execution run and final results of our measured metrics (both median and mean): Package (Joules), CPU (Joules), DRAM (Joules), GPU (Joules) and Time (Seconds).

SECTION IV.
Analysis and Discussion

This section presents the results collected by our preliminary study. The main focus is to understand if WebAssembly is already outperforming JavaScript when it comes both to energy consumption and run-time execution, considering that WebAssembly is still in a very early phase.

A. Results

Shown in Figure 3 are the results collected from the ten benchmarks executed in our study. Each individual chart represents one of the specific benchmarks. In each chart, the results are ordered (from left to right) by the input size of #Small, Medium, and Large, and within each size are the three languages.

The left most axis represents the amount of energy consumed (Joules) by the CPU (blue bars) and DRAM (green bars). The right most axis represents the run-time (Seconds), and corresponds to the orange line. Finally, the red dots represent the ratio between the energy consumed (here we are considering the sum of CPU and DRAM) and the time spent. In essence, this ratio can be seen as the average power (Watts) used. In terms of both energy and run-time efficiency, the lower the bars and orange line, the more efficient.

Figure 4 is a Heat map that shows the proportion between JavaScript and Wasm. The left axis represents the ten benchmarks and, in the last row, is the average of the above values. All types of results obtained are on the upper axis, including the tree input sizes, the Energy (Joules) and Time (ms) values, with the color scale shown on the right. If a value is greater than 1, it means that Wasm is better, in other words, more efficient. For example, for the Fannkuch-redux row and Small Time column, Wasm was shown to be 1.173x more efficient.

Finally, available in the benchmark's online page5 are also a set of violin plots for each benchmark and each metric. This allows us to display the entire density of our collected data, for both energy consumption and run-time, including outliers, median, and quartiles. These plots allow us to understand whether a language is consistent or has very inconsistent performances.

B. Discussion

The main focus of this study is to compare the energy and run-time performance between Wasm and JavaScript. As we needed C source code to generate equivalent Wasm and JavaScript programs, we included it as a reference point to compare the performance of Wasm and JavaScript to one of the most run-time and energy efficient languages [4].

Fig. 3.

Energy consumed by the CPU and DRAM for each benchmark with the three input sizes and the respective execution time.

As expected, C is by far more efficient than Wasm and JavaScript, both in terms of energy and run-time performance. The only exception is in the Bead Sorting benchmark, where the execution time ends up being higher than Wasm and JavaScript with a Large input. However, its energy consumption is significantly lower. Another essential detail of the C programming language performance is that when the input size increases, the performance difference between C and the other two languages (Wasm and JS) decreases. This may be due to emcc optimization flags, similar to gcc, clang, and other compilers, which further apply additional optimization specifically for WebAssembly.

The results of Wasm and JavaScript are very similar, both energy efficient and run-time performance. The smallest and largest performance difference between them is 0.959x and 1.173x, respectively. Nevertheless, if we look closely, it is possible to notice several differences.

Beginning with CPU energy consumption, in all thirty tests (ten benchmarks, each one with three different inputs), Wasm is more energetically efficient than JavaScript across twenty-six cases (87%). It is less efficient in the cases of Small input Fasta, Medium input Fasta, and twice with Large input Fasta and Fannkuch-redux. The same happens with DRAM consumption, but not in the same benchmarks, which may be due to different algorithms using more or less memory. With DRAM, it happens two times with Small input Sorting-circle and Fasta, and with Large input Sorting-quick and Fannkuch-redux. With Medium input, Wasm is always more efficient ARQ2. Wasm is faster in twenty-five of thirty cases when it comes to run-time performance ARQ1. By observing the ratio values (or, in other words, the average Power in kW), Wasm only uses more Power in ten cases. It is a consequence of taking less time to execute the programs. Even so, it is more efficient two-thirds of the time. WebAssembly's compact code format and its low-level nature means that it can load, parse, and compile the code faster than JavaScript.

Figure 4 presents how efficient each benchmark was for a given performance metric and within each benchmarked case. For example, in the Fannkuch-redux benchmark, Wasm had both its best and worst performance when compared to JavaScript. Using the Small and Medium inputs, Wasm presented the results but, when looking at the Large input, Wasm had the worst results across all thirty tests. The worst benchmark for Wasm was the Fasta benchmark, where JavaScript was more energetically efficient with the three inputs, and faster with Small and Medium input. Thus, the results show that currently Wasm is in general both more runtime (ARQ1), and energy efficient (ARQ2).

When comparing the three inputs, is clear that Wasm is more energetically efficient and faster than JavaScript with smaller inputs. However, with larger inputs, Wasm does continue to be more energy and run-time efficient but with a much smaller difference. Additionally, while the performance gap between Wasm and JavaScript ends up being narrower with larger inputs, all three languages tend to maintain the same pattern ranking and ratio between each regardless of input scale within each individual case (ARQ3). The smaller difference (with larger inputs) for Wasm and JavaScript may be due to the Node.js virtual machine, which applies dynamic optimizations to improve the JavaScript speed, particularly the JIT compilation. Note that JIT optimization is more aggressive when the engine identifies hot loops. By contrast, the current WebAssembly virtual machine is very recent, thus optimization techniques for WebAssembly may not be mature yet.

Finally, we can say, looking at the last row (Average row) of Figure 4, that on average, Wasm is always more energetically efficient and faster than JavaScript (further repeating ARQ1/ARQ2). Considering the average of all tests and all inputs, Wasm is 1.044x more CPU energy efficient than JavaScript, 1.037x more DRAM energy efficient, and 1.036x more run-time efficient. While the results seem small, as Wasm is very novel and has much more room to grow, we expect that with the continued development and support that the language has, it may over time far surpass JavaScript.

SECTION V.
Threats to validity

The goal of this preliminary study is to both measure and understand the energetic and run-time behaviour between the novel Wasm and matured JavaScript languages. This section presents some threats to the validity of our study, separated into four categories [23].

Conclusion: While the difference between Wasm and JavaScript is small, there is a clear consistency in favor of Wasm. However, analyzing the impact of other hardware components (such as memory usage) deserve further analysis. Finally, while we mainly focused on sorting based benchmarks, further benchmarks should also be considered. However, all our data and benchmarking framework is made available and can be very easily extended to include further benchmarks.

Fig. 4.

Heat map representing the proportion between webassembly and javascript results.

Internal: To avoid internal factors which may interfere with our results, all benchmarked scenarios execute in the same manner with the same input, to which we additionally verified the produced output of each case. In addition, measurements were repeated 20 times, to which we calculated both median and mean values, with each being executed with the recommended Emscripten flags and commands. This allowed us to minimize uncontrollable system processes and software within the tested machine. Finally, the used energy measurement tool has been proven to be very accurate [4], [5], [10], [17]–​ [21].

Construct: We analyzed 10 different benchmark scenarios across 3 languages, each with 3 input sizes, totalling 90 different measured cases. The original C solutions were obtained from two commonly used programming language repositories, with the Wasm and JavaScript solutions being generated by the Emscripten compiler tool. This guaranteed that the algorithms are identical, and there is no basis to suspect that these solutions are better or worse than any other.

External: This threat concerns itself with the generalization of the results. At the time of our study, the novel WebAssembly language only appeared 4 years prior. As such, it is still in its infancy, with a large possibility of further evolution. While there seems to be a slight favor in performance of Wasm over JavaScript, the differences are small. Thus, results might not be considered completely stable and may vary throughout its early evolution. Nevertheless, considering the development team behind this language (W3C, Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Apple), and one principal objective being performance, we expect a continued improvement, and thus the performance differences we have observed in this study to be further highlighted and distanced.

SECTION VI.
Related Work

For the past two decades, JavaScript has been the most commonly supported scripting language. With the introduction of WebAssembly in 2017, its dominance is being tested.

There have been studies on analyzing comparing JavaScript's performance with numerical computations with that of native code [24], showing that in certain cases it can actually be run-time efficient. Other researchers have studied JavaScript performance issues through analyzing popular client-side and server-side projects [25]. They found that inefficient usage of APIs was the most leading cause for such problems, which could be solved with very minor optimizations.

Finally, a study on the performance of JavaScript versus C++, based on common searching and sorting algorithms, has been previously carried out showing how JavaScript falls off whenever greater processing power is needed [26]. However, these studies did not compare JavaScript performance with a direct substitute language, and only focused on run-time performance.

Similar studies analyzing WebAssembly performance have been carried out. An independent analysis looked at the performance between WebAssembly and JavaScript in the context of browser based gaming, specifically emulating a Gameboy [27]. The study showed that WebAssembly performed much better, in terms of run-time, than JavaScript. Additionally, its resource efficiency allowed the game to be played on budget mobile devices and Chromebooks. WebAssembly's own engineers have performed preliminary studies on run-time performance [7], but these were small performance micro-benchmarks, and file size comparison against JavaScript. Researchers have also carried out a large-scale analysis on the run-time performance of Wasm vs. native code [6] within two different browsers (Chrome and Firefox). Their results showed that native code is much more run-time efficient (as expected). Surprisingly enough, WebAssembly performed very differently across the two browsers, being much more inefficient with the former. While these studies looked at Wasm and its run-time performance, they did not consider its energy efficiency performance.

Finally, several researchers have looked at the performance, both run-time and energy efficiency, of several programming languages in contexts such as mobile [9], desktop and server [3]–​ [5], [10], [11], and embedded systems [12], [13]. However, none of these studies considered the run-time and energy efficiency of the WebAssembly language.

SECTION VII.
Conclusions And Future Directions

In this paper, we present a preliminary study and its results on the run-time and energy efficiency performance between three languages: the web's primary language (JavaScript) its newer and promising competitor (WebAssembly), and a native language (C). We monitored the energy consumed and execution time of 10 computer programs, when executed with three different input sizes.

Unsurprisingly, C continues to be the fastest and greenest programming language. However, between WebAssembly and JavaScript, the results show that there is already a very slight difference in performance, with WebAssembly being quicker and more energy efficient in most cases, albeit not with any huge margins. The results also show that the bigger the program input size, the smaller the performance gap between WebAssembly and JavaScript.

In this study, we only executed the WebAssembly and JavaScript programs on Node.js. As future work, we plan to extend our study to include other computational intensive benchmarks and web based applications, while also extending the framework to allow measuring the performance within a browser based environment (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, and Edge), and with strong statistical tests. We also plan to study memory usage alongside energy consumption and run-time execution. Finally, our benchmarking framework is open source5, for researchers and practitioners to replicate and build upon.
