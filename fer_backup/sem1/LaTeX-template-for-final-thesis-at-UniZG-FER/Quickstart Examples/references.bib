  abstract =     {We consider the problem of shape recovery for real
                  world scenes, where a variety of global illumination
                  (inter-reflections, subsurface scattering, etc.) and
                  illumination defocus effects are present. These
                  effects introduce systematic and often significant
                  errors in the recovered shape. We introduce a
                  structured light technique called Micro Phase
                  Shifting, which overcomes these problems. The key
                  idea is to project sinusoidal patterns with
                  frequencies limited to a narrow, high-frequency
                  band. These patterns produce a set of images over
                  which global illumination and defocus effects remain
                  constant for each point in the scene. This enables
                  high quality reconstructions of scenes which have
                  traditionally been considered hard, using only a
                  small number of images. We also derive theoretical
                  lower bounds on the number of input images needed
                  for phase shifting and show that Micro PS achieves
                  the bound.},
