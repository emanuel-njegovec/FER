  abstract =     {Imaging of objects under variable lighting
                  directions is an important and frequent practice in
                  computer vision, machine vision, and image-based
                  rendering. Methods for such imaging have
                  traditionally used only a single light source per
                  acquired image. They may result in images that are
                  too dark and noisy, e.g., due to the need to avoid
                  saturation of highlights. We introduce an approach
                  that can significantly improve the quality of such
                  images, in which multiple light sources illuminate
                  the object simultaneously from different
                  directions. These illumination-multiplexed frames
                  are then computationally demultiplexed. The approach
                  is useful for imaging dim objects, as well as
                  objects having a specular reflection component. We
                  give the optimal scheme by which lighting should be
                  multiplexed to obtain the highest quality output,
                  for signal-independent noise. The scheme is based on
                  Hadamard codes. The consequences of imperfections
                  such as stray light, saturation, and noisy
                  illumination sources are then studied. In addition,
                  the paper analyzes the implications of shot noise,
                  which is signal-dependent, to Hadamard
                  multiplexing. The approach facilitates practical
                  lighting setups having high directional
                  resolution. This is shown by a setup we devise,
                  which is flexible, scalable, and programmable. We
                  used it to demonstrate the benefit of multiplexing
                  in experiments.},

  abstract =     {We consider the problem of shape recovery for real
                  world scenes, where a variety of global illumination
                  (inter-reflections, subsurface scattering, etc.) and
                  illumination defocus effects are present. These
                  effects introduce systematic and often significant
                  errors in the recovered shape. We introduce a
                  structured light technique called Micro Phase
                  Shifting, which overcomes these problems. The key
                  idea is to project sinusoidal patterns with
                  frequencies limited to a narrow, high-frequency
                  band. These patterns produce a set of images over
                  which global illumination and defocus effects remain
                  constant for each point in the scene. This enables
                  high quality reconstructions of scenes which have
                  traditionally been considered hard, using only a
                  small number of images. We also derive theoretical
                  lower bounds on the number of input images needed
                  for phase shifting and show that Micro PS achieves
                  the bound.},

	abstract = {WebAssembly has emerged as a low-level language for the web and beyond. Despite its popularity in different domains, little is known about WebAssembly binaries that occur in the wild. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 8,461 unique WebAssembly binaries gathered from a wide range of sources, including source code repositories, package managers, and live websites. We study the security properties, source languages, and use cases of the binaries and how they influence the security of the WebAssembly ecosystem. Our findings update some previously held assumptions about real-world WebAssembly and highlight problems that call for future research. For example, we show that vulnerabilities that propagate from insecure source languages potentially affect a wide range of binaries (e.g., two thirds of the binaries are compiled from memory unsafe languages, such as C and C++) and that 21\% of all binaries import potentially dangerous APIs from their host environment. We also show that cryptomining, which once accounted for the majority of all WebAssembly code, has been marginalized (less than 1\% of all binaries found on the web) and gives way to a diverse set of use cases. Finally, 29\% of all binaries on the web are minified, calling for techniques to decompile and reverse engineer WebAssembly. Overall, our results show that WebAssembly has left its infancy and is growing up into a language that powers a diverse ecosystem, with new challenges and opportunities for security researchers and practitioners. Besides these insights, we also share the dataset underlying our study, which is 58 times larger than the largest previously reported benchmark.},
